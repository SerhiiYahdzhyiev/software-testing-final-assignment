# Retrieve All Users with Authorized Request

- **Technique**: Automated Testing (Vitest)  
- **Test Level**: Integration (Backend)  
- **Objective**: Ensure that an authorized user can retrieve a list of all users with a valid request.

## Preconditions

- MongoDB memory server is running.
- A valid user with `ADMIN` role is logged in and has a valid token.
- The application backend is running and connected to the in-memory database.

## Steps

1. Send a `GET` request to the `/users` endpoint with a valid authorization token:
   ```text
   Cookie: token={token}
   ```
2. Validate that the response status is `200 OK`.
3. Check the response body to ensure it contains a list of users (`elements`).
4. Validate that the `success` field in the response is `true`.
5. Verify that the number of users in the `elements` list matches the expected count (should be `2` in this case).

## Expected Result

- The response returns status `200 OK`.
- The response body contains the `elements` list with the correct number of users.
- The `success` field in the response is `true`.
