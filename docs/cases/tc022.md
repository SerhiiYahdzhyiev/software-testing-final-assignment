# Unauthorized Order Actions Prevention

- **Technique**: Automated Testing (Vitest)  
- **Test Level**: Integration (Backend)  
- **Objective**: Ensure that unauthorized users cannot create or modify orders.

## Preconditions

- MongoDB memory server is running.
- A valid user with `ADMIN` role is logged in.
- The application backend is running and connected to the in-memory database.
- A valid `orderId` and `productId` exist in the database.

## Steps

1. Send a `POST` request to the `/orders/create` endpoint without a valid authorization token:
   ```json
   {
     "userId": "{userId}",
     "productsIds": ["{productId}"]
   }
   ```
2. Validate that the response status is `401 Unauthorized`.
3. Send a `PUT` request to the `/orders/{id}` endpoint (replace `{id}` with `validId`) without a valid authorization token:
   ```json
   {
     "productsIds": ["{productId}"]
   }
   ```
4. Validate that the response status is `401 Unauthorized`.

## Expected Result

- The response returns status `401 Unauthorized` for both `POST` and `PUT` requests.
- No order creation or modification is performed in the database.
