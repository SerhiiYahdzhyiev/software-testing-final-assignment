# User Creation with Valid Payload and Authorized User

- **Technique**: Automated Testing (Vitest)  
- **Test Level**: Integration (Backend)  
- **Objective**: Ensure that a new user can be created when the payload is valid and the request is authorized.

## Preconditions

- MongoDB memory server is running.
- A valid user with `ADMIN` role is logged in and has a valid token.
- The application backend is running and connected to the in-memory database.

## Steps

1. Send a `POST` request to the `/users/create` endpoint with a valid payload and authorization token:
   ```json
   {
     "firstName": "Jane",
     "lastName": "Doe",
     "email": "jane.doe@mail.com",
     "password": "Secret43",
     "phoneNumber": "0000000000"
   }
   ```
   - Include the authorization token in the request:
     ```text
     Cookie: token={token}
     ```
2. Validate that the response status is `200 OK`.
3. Query the database to confirm the user was created with the provided data.

## Expected Result

- The response returns status `200 OK`.
- A new user is successfully created in the database with the provided details.
