# Unauthorized User Actions Prevention

- **Technique**: Automated Testing (Vitest)  
- **Test Level**: Integration (Backend)  
- **Objective**: Ensure that unauthorized requests are unable to create or modify user data.

## Preconditions

- MongoDB memory server is running.
- A valid user with `ADMIN` role is registered and logged in.
- The application backend is running and connected to the in-memory database.

## Steps

1. Send a `POST` request to the `/users/create` endpoint without a valid authorization token:
   ```json
   {
     "firstName": "John",
     "lastName": "Doe",
     "email": "john.doe@mail.com",
     "password": "Secret42",
     "phoneNumber": "0000000000"
   }
   ```
2. Validate that the response status is `401 Unauthorized`.
3. Send a `PUT` request to the `/users/{id}` endpoint (replace `{id}` with the `validId`) without a valid authorization token:
   ```json
   {
     "countryCode": "+42"
   }
   ```
4. Validate that the response status is `401 Unauthorized`.

## Expected Result

- The response returns status `401 Unauthorized` for both `POST` and `PUT` requests.
- No user creation or modification is performed in the database.
