# Allow Product Retrieval for Unauthorized Requests

- **Technique**: Automated Testing (Vitest)  
- **Test Level**: Integration (Backend)  
- **Objective**: Ensure that product data can be retrieved by unauthorized (unauthenticated) requests.

## Preconditions

- MongoDB memory server is running.
- The application backend is running and connected to the in-memory database.
- A product with a valid `productId` exists in the database.

## Steps

1. Send a `GET` request to the `/products` endpoint without a valid authorization token:
   ```text
   Cookie: token=""
   ```
2. Validate that the response status is `200 OK`.
3. Check the response body to ensure it contains a list of products (`elements`).
4. Send a `GET` request to the `/products/{id}` endpoint (replace `{id}` with `validId`) without a valid authorization token:
   ```text
   Cookie: token=""
   ```
5. Validate that the response status is `200 OK`.
6. Check the response body to ensure it contains the product data for the requested `productId`.

## Expected Result

- The response returns status `200 OK` for both requests (`GET /products` and `GET /products/{id}`).
- The response body contains the list of products and the product details for the specific `productId`.
