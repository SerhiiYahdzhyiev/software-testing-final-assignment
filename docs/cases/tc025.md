# Block Unauthorized Access to Orders

- **Technique**: Automated Testing (Vitest)  
- **Test Level**: Integration (Backend)  
- **Objective**: Ensure that unauthorized users cannot retrieve orders, either through listing all orders or querying specific order information.

## Preconditions

- MongoDB memory server is running.
- A valid user with `ADMIN` role is registered.
- The application backend is running and connected to the in-memory database.
- A valid `orderId` exists in the database.

## Steps

1. Send a `GET` request to the `/orders` endpoint without a valid authorization token:
   ```text
   Cookie: token=""
   ```
2. Validate that the response status is `401 Unauthorized`.
3. Send a `GET` request to the `/orders/{id}` endpoint (replace `{id}` with `validId`) without a valid authorization token:
   ```text
   Cookie: token=""
   ```
4. Validate that the response status is `401 Unauthorized`.

## Expected Result

- The response returns status `401 Unauthorized` for both requests (`GET /orders` and `GET /orders/{id}`).
- No order data is returned, and unauthorized access is blocked.
