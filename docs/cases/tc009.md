# Token Returned in Set-Cookie on Successful Login  

- **Technique**: Automated Testing (Vitest)  
- **Test Level**: Integration (Backend)  
- **Objective**: Ensure that a valid token is returned in the `Set-Cookie` header when a user successfully logs in.

## Preconditions

- MongoDB memory server is running.
- A valid user is registered in the system.
- The application backend is running and connected to the in-memory database.

## Steps

1. Send a `POST` request to the `/auth/register` endpoint to register a new user:
   ```json
   {
     "firstName": "John",
     "lastName": "Doe",
     "email": "john.doe@mail.com",
     "password": "Secret42",
     "countryCode": "+38",
     "phoneNumber": "0000000000",
     "deliveryAddress": "Some address"
   }
   ```
2. Send a `POST` request to the `/auth/login` endpoint with the valid user's credentials:
   ```json
   {
     "login": "john.doe@mail.com",
     "password": "Secret42"
   }
   ```
3. Validate that the response status is `204 No Content`.
4. Check the response headers for the `Set-Cookie` field.
5. Verify that the `Set-Cookie` header contains the authentication token.

## Expected Result
- The response returns status `204 No Content`.
- The `Set-Cookie` header contains a valid authentication token (e.g., `token=...`).
