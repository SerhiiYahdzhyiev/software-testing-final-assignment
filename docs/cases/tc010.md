# Token Removed from Set-Cookie on Successful Logout  

- **Technique**: Automated Testing (Vitest)  
- **Test Level**: Integration (Backend)  
- **Objective**: Ensure that the token is removed from the `Set-Cookie` header when a user logs out, effectively ending the session.

## Preconditions

- MongoDB memory server is running.
- A valid user is registered in the system.
- The application backend is running and connected to the in-memory database.
- The user is logged in and has a valid token.

## Steps
1. Send a `POST` request to the `/auth/register` endpoint to register a new user:
   ```json
   {
     "firstName": "John",
     "lastName": "Doe",
     "email": "john.doe@mail.com",
     "password": "Secret42",
     "countryCode": "+38",
     "phoneNumber": "0000000000",
     "deliveryAddress": "Some address"
   }
   ```
2. Send a `POST` request to the `/auth/login` endpoint with valid credentials to log the user in.
3. Capture the `Set-Cookie` header from the login response (which contains the token).
4. Send a `GET` request to `/auth/logout` with the captured token in the request headers (`Cookie`).
5. Validate that the response status is `204 No Content`.
6. Check the `Set-Cookie` header of the logout response.
7. Verify that the `Set-Cookie` header no longer contains the token (e.g., `token=;`).

## Expected Result

- The response returns status `204 No Content`.
- The `Set-Cookie` header in the logout response is set to remove the token (e.g., `token=;`).
- The session is effectively ended, and the user is logged out.
