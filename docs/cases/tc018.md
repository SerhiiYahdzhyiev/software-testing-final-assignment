# Product Creation with Valid Payload and Authorized User

- **Technique**: Automated Testing (Vitest)  
- **Test Level**: Integration (Backend)  
- **Objective**: Ensure that an authorized user can successfully create a product with a valid payload.

## Preconditions

- MongoDB memory server is running.
- A valid user with `ADMIN` role is logged in and has a valid token.
- The application backend is running and connected to the in-memory database.

## Steps

1. Send a `POST` request to the `/products/create` endpoint with a valid product payload and authorization token:
   ```json
   {
     "title": "New Product",
     "price": 200,
     "description": "New product description",
     "quantity": 10
   }
   ```
   - Include the authorization token in the request:
     ```text
     Cookie: token={token}
     ```
2. Validate that the response status is `200 OK`.
3. Check the response body for the newly created product's ID (`id`).
4. Query the database to confirm the product was created with the provided details.

## Expected Result

- The response returns status `200 OK`.
- A new product is successfully created in the database with the provided details.
- The response body contains the product's `id`.
