# User Login with Invalid Credentials  

- **Technique**: Automated Testing (Vitest)  
- **Test Level**: Integration (Backend)  
- **Objective**: Ensure that the login endpoint returns a non-`204` status code and an appropriate error response when incorrect credentials are provided.

## Preconditions
jk
- MongoDB memory server is running.
- A valid user is registered in the system.
- The application backend is running and connected to the in-memory database.

## Steps

1. Send a `POST` request to the `/auth/register` endpoint to register a new user:
   ```json
   {
     "firstName": "John",
     "lastName": "Doe",
     "email": "john.doe@mail.com",
     "password": "Secret42",
     "countryCode": "+38",
     "phoneNumber": "0000000000",
     "deliveryAddress": "Some address"
   }
   ```
2. Send a `POST` request to the `/auth/login` endpoint with incorrect login credentials:
   ```json
   {
     "login": "john.doe@mail.com",
     "password": "wrong"
   }
   ```
3. Validate that the response status is not `204 No Content` and indicates an authentication error.
4. Send another `POST` request to `/auth/login` with a valid password but an incorrect email:
   ```json
   {
     "login": "invalid@mail.com",
     "password": "Secret42"
   }
   ```
5. Validate that the response status is not `204 No Content` and contains an appropriate error message.

## Expected Result

- The response returns a status other than `204 No Content` for both incorrect password and email cases.
- The response includes an appropriate error message without exposing sensitive information (e.g., no mention of incorrect passwords).
