# Retrieve Order with Authorized Request

- **Technique**: Automated Testing (Vitest)  
- **Test Level**: Integration (Backend)  
- **Objective**: Ensure that an authorized user can retrieve a specific order's details with a valid request.

## Preconditions

- MongoDB memory server is running.
- A valid user with `ADMIN` role is logged in and has a valid token.
- The application backend is running and connected to the in-memory database.
- A valid `orderId` exists in the database.

## Steps

1. Send a `GET` request to the `/orders/{id}` endpoint (replace `{id}` with `validId`) with a valid authorization token:
   ```text
   Cookie: token={token}
   ```
2. Validate that the response status is `200 OK`.
3. Check the response body to ensure it contains the order data for the requested `orderId`, including:
   - `status` is `PENDING`.
   - `userId` matches the expected user.
   - `productsIds` contains the correct product(s).

## Expected Result

- The response returns status `200 OK`.
- The response body contains the order details for the specific `orderId`.
- The order details, such as `status`, `userId`, and `productsIds`, match the expected data.
