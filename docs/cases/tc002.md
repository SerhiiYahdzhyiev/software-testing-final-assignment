# Token Handling, Expiration and Revokation

- **Technique:** Static code review 
- **Objective:** Ensure that authentication tokens (e.g., JWT) are securely
                 generated, stored, expired and revoked to prevent unauthorized
                 access.

## Checklist

- [ ] Token Encryption with secure algorithm.
- [ ] Token Expiration: verify that generated tokens have reasonable expiration
      time set to limit token exposure.
- [ ] Token Revocation/Invalidation mechanism in place.
- [ ] No Tokens are transmited in plain text, hardcoded, or exposed via logs.
- [ ] Secure token transfering mechanism
