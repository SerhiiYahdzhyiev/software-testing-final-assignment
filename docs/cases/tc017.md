# Unauthorized Product Actions Prevention

- **Technique**: Automated Testing (Vitest)  
- **Test Level**: Integration (Backend)  
- **Objective**: Ensure that unauthorized requests are unable to create or modify product data.

## Preconditions

- MongoDB memory server is running.
- A valid user with `ADMIN` role is registered and logged in.
- The application backend is running and connected to the in-memory database.
- A valid product exists with a `productId`.

## Steps

1. Send a `POST` request to the `/products/create` endpoint without a valid authorization token:
   ```json
   {
     "title": "Sample Product",
     "price": 100,
     "description": "Sample description"
   }
   ```
2. Validate that the response status is `401 Unauthorized`.
3. Send a `PUT` request to the `/products/{id}` endpoint (replace `{id}` with `validId`) without a valid authorization token:
   ```json
   {
     "title": "New Product Title"
   }
   ```
4. Validate that the response status is `401 Unauthorized`.

## Expected Result

- The response returns status `401 Unauthorized` for both `POST` and `PUT` requests.
- No product creation or modification is performed in the database.
