# User Login with Valid Credentials

- **Technique**: Automated Testing (Vitest)  
- **Test Level**: Integration (Backend)  
- **Objective**: Ensure that a user can successfully log in with valid credentials, and a proper status code is returned. Additionally, the user's password must be securely hashed in the database.

## Preconditions
- MongoDB memory server is running.
- A valid user is registered in the system.
- The application backend is running and connected to the in-memory database.

## Steps

1. Send a `POST` request to the `/auth/register` endpoint to register a new user:
   ```json
   {
     "firstName": "John",
     "lastName": "Doe",
     "email": "john.doe@mail.com",
     "password": "Secret42",
     "countryCode": "+38",
     "phoneNumber": "0000000000",
     "deliveryAddress": "Some address"
   }
   ```
2. Query the database to confirm the user was created and that the password is stored securely (hashed).
3. Send a `POST` request to the `/auth/login` endpoint with the valid user's login credentials:
   ```json
   {
     "login": "john.doe@mail.com",
     "password": "Secret42"
   }
   ```
4. Validate that the response status is `204 No Content`.

## Expected Result

- The user is successfully created in the database with a securely hashed password.
- The response to the login request returns status `204 No Content`.
- The user is successfully authenticated with valid credentials.
