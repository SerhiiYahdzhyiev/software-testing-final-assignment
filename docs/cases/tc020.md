# Product Update with Valid Payload and Authorized User

- **Technique**: Automated Testing (Vitest)  
- **Test Level**: Integration (Backend)  
- **Objective**: Ensure that an authorized user can successfully update an existing product with a valid payload.

## Preconditions

- MongoDB memory server is running.
- A valid user with `ADMIN` role is logged in and has a valid token.
- The application backend is running and connected to the in-memory database.
- A product with a valid `productId` exists in the database.

## Steps

1. Send a `PUT` request to the `/products/{id}` endpoint (replace `{id}` with `validId`) with a valid payload to update the product’s information:
   ```json
   {
     "title": "New Product Title"
   }
   ```
   - Include the authorization token in the request:
     ```text
     Cookie: token={token}
     ```
2. Validate that the response status is `200 OK`.
3. Check the response body for the updated product ID (`updatedId`).
4. Query the database to confirm that the product’s data has been updated correctly.

## Expected Result

- The response returns status `200 OK`.
- The product’s information is updated in the database (e.g., `title` should be updated to "New Product Title").
- The response contains the `updatedId` of the modified product.
