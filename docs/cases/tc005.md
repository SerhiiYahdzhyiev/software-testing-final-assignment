# User Registration with Invalid Payload  

- **Technique**: Automated Testing (Vitest)  
- **Test Level**: Integration (Backend)  
- **Objective**: Ensure that the registration endpoint returns a `400 Bad Request` status when the payload contains invalid data, preventing user creation with incorrect inputs.

## Preconditions

- MongoDB memory server is running.
- The application backend is running and connected to the in-memory database.

## Steps

1. Send a `POST` request to the `/auth/register` endpoint with an invalid registration payload (e.g., an invalid phone number):
   ```json
   {
     "firstName": "John",
     "lastName": "Doe",
     "email": "john.doe@mail.com",
     "password": "Secret42",
     "countryCode": "+38",
     "phoneNumber": "invalid",
     "deliveryAddress": "Some address"
   }
   ```
2. Validate that the response status is `400 Bad Request`.
3. Check the response body for an appropriate error message indicating the reason for the failure (e.g., invalid phone number format).

## Expected Result

- The response returns status `400 Bad Request`.
- The user is not created in the database.
- The response contains an error message indicating that the phone number is invalid.
