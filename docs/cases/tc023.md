# Order Creation with Valid Payload and Authorized User

- **Technique**: Automated Testing (Vitest)  
- **Test Level**: Integration (Backend)  
- **Objective**: Ensure that an authorized user can successfully create an order with a valid payload.

## Preconditions

- MongoDB memory server is running.
- A valid user with `ADMIN` role is logged in and has a valid token.
- The application backend is running and connected to the in-memory database.
- A valid `userId` and `productId` exist in the database.

## Steps

1. Send a `POST` request to the `/orders/create` endpoint with a valid payload and authorization token:
   ```json
   {
     "userId": "{userId}",
     "productsIds": ["{productId}"]
   }
   ```
   - Include the authorization token in the request:
     ```text
     Cookie: token={token}
     ```
2. Validate that the response status is `200 OK`.
3. Check the response body to ensure the order is successfully created with an `orderId`.

## Expected Result

- The response returns status `200 OK`.
- The order is successfully created in the database.
- The response body contains the newly created `orderId`.
