# Order Update with Valid Payload and Authorized User

- **Technique**: Automated Testing (Vitest)  
- **Test Level**: Integration (Backend)  
- **Objective**: Ensure that an authorized user can successfully update an existing order with a valid payload.

## Preconditions

- MongoDB memory server is running.
- A valid user with `ADMIN` role is logged in and has a valid token.
- The application backend is running and connected to the in-memory database.
- A valid `orderId` exists in the database.
- A valid `productId` exists in the database.

## Steps

1. Send a `PUT` request to the `/orders/{id}` endpoint (replace `{id}` with `validId`) with a valid payload to update the order's information:
   ```json
   {
     "userId": "{userId}",
     "productsIds": ["{productId}"],
     "totalPrice": 1337
   }
   ```
   - Include the authorization token in the request:
     ```text
     Cookie: token={token}
     ```
2. Validate that the response status is `200 OK`.
3. Check the response body for the updated order ID (`updatedId`).
4. Query the database to confirm that the order’s data (e.g., `totalPrice`) has been updated correctly.

## Expected Result

- The response returns status `200 OK`.
- The order’s information is updated in the database (e.g., `totalPrice` should be updated to `1337`).
- The response contains the `updatedId` of the modified order.
