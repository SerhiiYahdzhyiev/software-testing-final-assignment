# Prevent Admin Account Creation via Registration  

- **Technique**: Automated Testing (Vitest)  
- **Test Level**: Integration (Backend)  
- **Objective**: Ensure that users cannot register with the `ADMIN` role, and the system returns an error status when an attempt to register as an admin is made.

## Preconditions
- MongoDB memory server is running.
- The application backend is running and connected to the in-memory database.

## Steps
1. Send a `POST` request to the `/auth/register` endpoint with a registration payload that includes the `ADMIN` role:
   ```json
   {
     "firstName": "John",
     "lastName": "Doe",
     "email": "john.doe@mail.com",
     "password": "Secret42",
     "countryCode": "+38",
     "phoneNumber": "0000000000",
     "deliveryAddress": "Some address",
     "role": "ADMIN"
   }
   ```
2. Validate that the response status is not `200 OK` (should be an error status).
3. Check that the response body does not include a user ID (`id`).
4. Query the database to ensure that the user was not created with an `ADMIN` role.
5. Ensure that no user was created in the database at all.

## Expected Result

- The response returns a non-`200` status code (indicating an error).
- The response body does not contain a user ID.
- No user with the `ADMIN` role is created in the database.
- The database does not store the user at all.
