# User registration with valid payload

- **Technique:** Automated testing (vitest)
- **Level**: Integration(Backend)
- **Objective:** Ensure that a user can successfully register with valid data,
                 and the user’s details are stored correctly in the database.

## Preconditions

- MongoDB memory server is running.
- The application backaend is running and connected to the in-memory database.

## Steps

1. Send a `POST` request to the `/auth/register` endpoint with a valid registration payload:
   ```json
   {
     "firstName": "John",
     "lastName": "Doe",
     "email": "john.doe@mail.com",
     "password": "Secret42",
     "countryCode": "+38",
     "phoneNumber": "0000000000",
     "deliveryAddress": "Some address"
   }
   ```
2. Validate that the response status is `200 OK`.
3. Check that the response body contains a new user ID (`id`).
4. Query the database to retrieve the user by their ID.
5. Verify that the user’s details in the database (e.g., `firstName`, `email`, `countryCode`, etc.) match the registration payload.

## **Expected Result**:

- The response returns status `200 OK`.
- The response contains a user ID (`id`).
- The user’s details are stored in the database and match the registration payload.
- The password is securely hashed and not stored in plaintext.
